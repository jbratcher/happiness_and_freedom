# Happiness and Freedom

**A brief review of the World Happiness Report and Human Freedom Index in terms of how presence of freedom affects happiness.**  

Analysis derived from data using the most recent World Happiness Report ([link](http://worldhappiness.report/)) and Human Freedom Index ([link](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index-new)).

"The secret to happiness is freedom... and the secret to freedom is courage." - Thucydides ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides))

It seems obvious that freedom leads to happiness but how much and how do different kinds of freedoms contribute to the overall picture?  We'll take a look at each category of freedom's relationship with reported happiness and it's own categories.  The aim is to create an overview of the two datasets, their relationship, and find strongly correlated categories from the two datasets.

#### General Observations

* Freedom is positively correlated with happiness.  (A gut check)
* How do the top and bottom 10 countries compare in happiness to freedom?

#### Human Freedom Index Overview

* How do the two main categories of freedom (personal and economic) affect happiness and how does it differ in that effect?
* Examining the subcategories of personal freedom (top level).
* Examining the subcategories of economic freedom (top level).

#### World Happiness Report Overview

* How is each category related to overall happiness and rank?
* How does each correlate to the strongest freedom category?

#### Happiness in relation to individual freedom of movement

* How does freedom of movement affect happiness?  Individuals that can move freely should be more happy than those under more restrictions.
* How does gender affect freedom of movement?  Does gender play a role in in freedom of movement.  How does this affect happiness?

#### Happiness and relative geographic isolation

* How does geographic isolation relate to happiness?  Are people in landlocked countries less happy than those in coastal countries?
* How does geographic isolation relate to freedom of movement?  Are people in landlocked countries or coastal countries more free to move around?
